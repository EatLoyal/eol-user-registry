# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# Start local Hardhat network
npx hardhat node

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy locally
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
